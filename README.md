# Minimum Spanning Tree

This is a Python program that calculates the minimum spanning tree of a weighted undirected graph using Prim's algorithm.

Requirements

Python 3.6 or above
How to use

Download or clone the repository to your local machine.
Navigate to the directory containing the minimum_spanning_tree.py file.
Open a terminal or command prompt and run the command python minimum_spanning_tree.py.
The program will prompt you to enter the graph by specifying the nodes and their weights. Follow the prompts to input the data.
After inputting all the edges, the program will output the minimum spanning tree of the graph.
Example

mathematica
Copy code
Enter the nodes of an edge (or press enter to stop): A B
Enter the weight of the edge: 1
Add another edge? (y/n): y
Enter the nodes of an edge (or press enter to stop): A C
Enter the weight of the edge: 3
Add another edge? (y/n): y
Enter the nodes of an edge (or press enter to stop): B C
Enter the weight of the edge: 2
Add another edge? (y/n): n
The minimum spanning tree of the graph is:
A -- B : 1
B -- C : 2
Total weight: 3
